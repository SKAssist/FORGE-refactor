FORGE is a VSCode extension that automatically refactors your Python code using Llama 3, then mathematically verifies the refactored code's equivalence to the original. Say goodbye to bugs introduced during refactoring and AI-generated code bloat.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Guaranteed Equivalence**: Formal verification ensures refactored code behaves exactly like the original  
- **Clean Refactoring**: Intelligent improvements without unnecessary abstractions or bloat  
- **Multi-Method Verification**: Z3 theorem proving, runtime testing, and property-based testing  
- **Feedback Loop**: When verification fails, FORGE iteratively refines the solution  
- **VSCode Integration**: Simple right-click to refactor selected code  
- **Cross-File References**: Automatically updates function calls across your project
