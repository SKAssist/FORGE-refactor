FORGE is a VSCode extension that automatically refactors your Python code using Llama 3, then mathematically verifies the refactored code's equivalence to the original. Say goodbye to bugs introduced during refactoring and AI-generated code bloat.

## âœ¨ Features

- **Guaranteed Equivalence**: Formal verification ensures refactored code behaves exactly like the original  
- **Clean Refactoring**: Intelligent improvements without unnecessary abstractions or bloat  
- **Multi-Method Verification**: Z3 theorem proving, runtime testing, and property-based testing  
- **Feedback Loop**: When verification fails, FORGE iteratively refines the solution  
- **VSCode Integration**: Simple right-click to refactor selected code  
- **Cross-File References**: Automatically updates function calls across your project  

## ðŸš€ Installation

Install directly from the VSCode Marketplace:

1. Open VSCode  
2. Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)  
3. Search for "FORGE Refactor"  
4. Click Install  

Or install via the command line:

```bash
code --install-extension FORGE.forge-refactor


FORGE uses three complementary verification methods to ensure code equivalence:

Z3 Theorem Proving
Mathematical proof that both implementations produce identical outputs for all possible inputs.

Runtime Testing
Dynamic testing with intelligently generated inputs covering edge cases and common usage patterns.

CrossHair Property-Based Testing
Symbolic execution to find potential inputs that would cause different behavior.

ðŸ§  How It Works
FORGE follows a sophisticated pipeline to ensure high-quality, verified refactoring:

Original code is parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree

LLM (Llama 3) generates refactored code based on analyzed structure

Verification engine applies multiple methods to check equivalence

If verification fails, LLM receives feedback to improve the refactoring

Process repeats until verified equivalent or max iterations reached
